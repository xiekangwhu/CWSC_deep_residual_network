# SMSC_gridded_based_monthly_water_balance_models

This code contains python code used to deep residual network for Soil moisture storage capacity (SMSC) reconstruction. Deep Residual Network (ResNet), one of the specific types of CNN method, can automatically learn features from large-scale data and generalize the results to unknown data of the same type. 

The inputs of the model include 15 inputs such as global meteorological data, soil and vegetation data, topographical data, and streamflow data. The SMSC parameters on the global grids obtained by the calibration algorithm are taken as the target labels of the model. On grids with KGE greater than 0, SMSC parameters can be obtained by calibration of the hydrological model.

Areas with KGE less than 0 are masked. On grids with KGE greater than zero, the samples are divided into training set and test set according to the ratio of 7:3. The model is run on a GPU (Nvidia Tesla V100 16GB) cluster, and takes 758 microseconds per step, for a total of about one hour.

Abstract

Soil moisture storage capacity (SMSC) links the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems, which is required as spatial parameters for geoscientific models, but there are currently no available parameter datasets of SMSC on a global scale especially for hydrological models. Here, we produce a dataset of SMSC parameter for global hydrological models. Parameter calibration of three commonly used monthly water balance models provides the labels for the deep residual network. Calibration on the global grids can significantly reduce parameter discontinuities compared to calibration on individual catchments. The global SMSC is reconstructed at 0.5Â° resolution by integrating 15 types of meteorological, topographic, and runoff data based on a deep residual network. SMSC products are validated with spatial distribution against root zone depth datasets and validated in terms of simulation efficiency on global grids and 20 catchments from different climatic regions, respectively. We provide the global SMSC parameter dataset as a benchmark for geoscientific modelling by users.
